    Minimal in-process sliding-window counter.

    SCOPE WARNING - read this before tuning the numbers above.

    This limiter lives in one Python process. Under `gunicorn -w N` (see Procfile)
    every worker keeps its own copy, so each published limit is really "limit per
    worker" and the cluster-wide ceiling is limit x N; counters also reset on every
    restart or deploy. It is therefore development / single-instance protection,
    not an exact production control.

    Which OTP limits ARE cluster-wide today, with no extra infrastructure:

      * the resend cooldown  - anchored on otp_verification.created_at in MySQL
                               (see send_otp), so it is exact across workers AND
                               hosts and survives restarts;
      * code invalidation    - crossing OTP_MAX_VERIFY_ATTEMPTS expires the row in
                               MySQL, which every worker immediately sees.

    Which are still per-worker (approximate):

      * the per-IP send and verify windows;
      * the per-identifier send count inside OTP_WINDOW_MINUTES;
      * the wrong-guess counter that decides WHEN to invalidate (the invalidation
        itself is durable, only the threshold is counted per worker).

    Making those exact needs storage shared by all workers. Deliberately NOT done
    here: a SQLite file adds a writable-path requirement, a busy-timeout/fail-open
    decision and per-host-only accuracy, and it would make limits survive restarts
    in a way that locks developers out of their own address. The correct upgrade is
    Redis + flask-limiter, which is documented in DEPLOYMENT_READINESS_REPORT.md
    and needs infrastructure this deployment does not yet have. Until then, size
    the env vars for the worker count: the effective ceiling is value x workers.

    is a user-typed secondary contact that is NOT OTP-verified, and it cannot be
